            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            Seclusive Utah was created with the ideal of improving the recreational experiences of
            all nature lovers by directing users of our website to the many lesser known parks and 
            recreational areas within the state of Utah.<br> Are you looking for a good place to see 
            the amazing array of stars lost to view because of light pollution in major cities?
            Seclusive Utah has a list of park areas that have been internationally recognized for 
            their 'dark sky' spectacular views of the stars; unpolluted by human generated light
             sources.<br> Perhaps you instead want a camping site where you can truly escape the 
             crowds and bustle of city life? Well, Seclusive Utah has a list of the least visited
             parks in Utah; based upon the Park Services 2025 visitation report. Recreation areas
             on that list that also include the "dark sky" criteria can truly offer a unique 
             and seclusive experience for site users. Should your experience prove different for 
             a specific recreation site that we list, simply contact us using our "contact page" link
             listed above; and we will remove that site from the list, and note it in our monthly
             Newsletter.<br>

            <img src="https://bbagnes.github.io/wdd231/project/images/garbage.webp" alt="Garbage strewn camping area" loading="lazy">
            As part of our effort to improve recreational experience, we at Seclusive Utah are 
            committed to maintaining Utah's recreation areas as pristine and natural as possible.
             We hold the paradigm, and we strongly encourage our site users to follow it's 
             practice to "leave it better than you found it." This means we remove our own waste
             from recreation areas; as well as any that may have been left by other, less 
             responsible recreators.<br>
             That is not to say that we expect a few lone individuals to manage the entire 
             endeavor of keeping Utah Pristine. To meet our goals to maintain recreation areas as
             clean and natural as possible we partner with local park rangers and others who share
             our values for monthly gatherings at selected sites to clean and restore them back to
             their natural state and beauty. If the effort to keep 'civilation', i.e. waste from 
             ruining the natural beauty of recreation areas for your loved ones and future generations
             please submit to our Newsletter using the link below; to receive news and updates on our
             site cleanup initiative and gathering dates; as well as updated information on our list
             of recreational sites. Working together, we can keep Utah Pristine!
